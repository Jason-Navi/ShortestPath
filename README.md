Program Description: 

Libraries used: iostream, algorithim, and string

IDE used: Dev C++

How to Run: Download the cpp file: "Shortest_Path.cpp" and run it any IDE. It will run and print the row path and shortest length of a path of the preset weight matrix. You can change any of the elements in the array to different numbers as well as the amount of rows and cols of the weight matrix as long as you fill it in with the appropriate integers greater than -1. You will also have to change the row and cols variables so that the path and cost matrix work accordingly.
