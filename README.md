# ShortestPath

Program Description: The goal of this program is to find the shortest path through a 2D grid, from left to right. A path visits one square or row in each column only once. Each square has to be adjacent to the previous square (horizontally or diagonally). The grid is cylindrical, which means that the top row is touching the bottom row. The number in each square or the weight represents how long it takes to go through that specific square. Thus, the objective is to go through the 2D matrix and create the shortest path with the shortest amount of time possible.

Libraries used: iostream, algorithim, and string

IDE used: Dev C++

How to Run: Download the cpp file: "Shortest_Path.cpp" and run it any IDE. It will run and print the row path and shortest length of a path of the preset weight matrix. You can change any of the elements in the array to different numbers as well as the amount of rows and cols of the weight matrix as long as you fill it in with the appropriate integers greater than -1. You will also have to change the row and cols variables so that the path and cost matrix work accordingly.
